Unfortunately, the provided sources do not contain information on calculating the square of a planet. However, based on the contexts provided, I can provide you with examples of how to calculate the square of a number in different programming languages.

1. **C Program to Calculate Square of a Number** [source](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/c-program-to-calculate-square-of-a-number/):
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number, Square;
    printf(" \n Please Enter any Number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    Square = Calculate_Square(number);
    printf("Square of %d = %d", number, Square);
    return 0;
}
int Calculate_Square(int Number) {
    return Number * Number;
}
```
2. **Python Program to Calculate Square of a Given Number** [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-profram-to-calculate-square-of-a-given-number/):
```python
def square(num):
    return num * num

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = square(num)
print(f"The square of {num} is {result}")
```
3. **C Program: Find the square of any number** [source](https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/function/c-function-exercise-2.php):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
double square(double num);
int main()
{
    double num, result;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &num);
    result = square(num);
    printf("Square of %.2lf = %.2lf", num, result);
    return 0;
}
double square(double Number)
{
    return Number * Number;
}
```

These code examples demonstrate how to calculate the square of a number in C, Python, and C++, respectively. However, if you need assistance in calculating the square of a planet's position, you may need to provide more specific information or consult additional resources.
